# JitExplorer

Like [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/), but for .NET JIT.

C# source code is compiled to an executable using [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn), then executed. While it is executing, and after JIT is complete, [ClrMD](https://github.com/microsoft/clrmd) is attached and the methods are decompiled using [Iced](https://github.com/0xd4d/iced). The code that does this comes from [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/tree/master/src/BenchmarkDotNet.Disassembler.x64).

The advantage of this approach vs using [JitDasm](https://github.com/0xd4d/JitDasm) is that it supports dissassembly of generic methods:

# TODO:

- Why is release version jitted code not matching benchmarkdotnet? Have tried making a release build console app, same result. So is not caused by Roslyn. Analyze code generated by benchmarkdot net, and try running exactly the same code (with warmup etc.)
- Background jit, without button.
- Better UI, pull down for language version, emit ass line nos, all jit compilation options etc.
- Fix dark theme: checkbox, code complete menu color, text area scroll bars
- Full code auto complete, like RoslynPad
